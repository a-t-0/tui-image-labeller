- typechecking
- pre-commit

## Usage

First install this pip package with:

```bash
pip install tui-labeller
```

Then run:

```sh
python -m tui_labeller
```

## Tests

```sh
python -m pytest
```

## UI specification

The user interface (UI) supports 3 types of questions:

- multiple choice questions (mc).
- questions with input validation (iv).
- questions that ask for a date (date).

### Autocomplete

There are two boxes with autocomplete suggestions:

- **AI Suggestions**: Provided as you type, filtered automatically based on input.
- **Past Input/History Suggestions**: Displays previous entries, also filtered by input.
  - Filtering uses patterns like `a*d` to match terms (e.g., `avocad(o)`).

#### date entries

You can apply AI suggestions with:

- `alt+u`: Applies the first remaining AI suggestion (if any).

#### input validation

you can apply AI or history suggestions (if any) with:

- `alt+u`: Applies the first remaining AI suggestion (if any).
- `ctrl+u`: Applies the first remaining past entry/history suggestion (if any).
- `tab`: Applies the only one remaining suggestion (either history or AI if only 1, in total, exists) (but not in date format) For:

#### multiple choice questions

The most probable AI answer is primary selected one. (The confidence probability is and model are displayed below the answer.)

### Navigation

One can navigate within question answer boxes, and amongst question answer boxes.

- Going **beyond the end** of a question moves to the next question.
- Going **before the start** of a question moves to the previous question.
- Going **beyond the last question** wraps to the start of the first question.
- Going **back from the first question** wraps to the end of the last question.

#### Navigation: Tab

To navigate between the types of questions the following keys can be used, which behave context dependent:
`tab`:

- **Input Validation**: Triggers autocomplete (see above) if a single autocomplete suggestion is left, goes to next question if multiple suggestions remain.
- **Date Questions - date only**: Moves to the next segment (`yyyy` → `mm` → `dd`)
  - At `dd`, moves to the next question.
- **Date Questions - date & time**: Moves to the next segment (`yyyy` → `mm` → `dd` → `hh`→ `mm`).
  - At `ss`, moves to the next question.
- **Multiple Choice**: Selects the next option and puts the cursor there.
  - At the last option, moves next question.

#### Navigation: Shift+Tab

## To navigate between the types of questions the following keys can be used, which behave context dependent: `tab`:

- **Input Validation**: `shift+tab` goes to the previous question.
- **Date Questions**: Moves to the previous segment (`yyyy` → `mm` → `dd`). At Y of `Yyyy`, moves to the previous question.
- **Multiple Choice**: Selects the previous option. At the first option, moves to the previous question.

#### Navigation: Enter

- `Enter`: Selects the current answer and moves to the next question. TODO: MC.
- `Shift+Enter`: (Shift is not detected when pressing enter with urwid.) Selects the current answer and moves to the previous question.

#### Navigation: Home, End

- `Home`: Moves the cursor to the start of the current question’s input field. If already at the start, moves to the first question in the form.
  - input validation: Done
  - date_question: Done
  - multiple choice: Done
- `End`: Moves the cursor to the end of the current question’s input field. If already at the end, moves to the last question in the form.
  - input validation: Done
  - date_question: Done
  - multiple choice: Done

#### Navigation: Up, Down

- **Multiple Choice**: `Up` moves to the previous question, `Down` to the next. Wraps from first to last (`Up`) or last to first (`Down`).
- **Input Validation**: `Up` moves to the previous question, `Down` to the next. Wraps similarly.
- For date questions: `Up` rolls the current digit/segment (e.g., `yyyy`, `mm`, `dd`) upward (increments), `Down` rolls it downward (decrements). Wrapping occurs at the segment’s valid range (e.g., 1-12 for `mm`).

#### Navigation: Left, Right

______________________________________________________________________

- **Multiple Choice**: `Left` selects the previous option, `Right` the next. At the first option, `Left` moves to the previous question; at the last, `Right` moves to the next.
- **Input Validation**: `Left` moves cursor left one character, `Right` moves right. At the start, `Left` moves to the previous question; at the end, `Right` moves to the next.
- **Date Questions**: `Left` moves cursor one digit left (e.g., `Yyyy` → `Yyy`), `Right` moves one digit right. At `Y` of `Yyyy`, `Left` moves to the previous question; at `D` of `dD`, `Right` moves to the next.

#### Navigation: Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right, Alt+Left, Alt+Right

- `Ctrl+Left` and `Ctrl+Right`: Scroll through history suggestions for autocomplete. `Ctrl+Left` moves to the previous history suggestion, `Ctrl+Right` moves to the next history suggestion. If no more suggestions, it stops.
- `Alt+Left` and `Alt+Right`: Scroll through AI suggestions for autocomplete. `Alt+Left` moves to the previous AI suggestion, `Alt+Right` moves to the next AI suggestion. If no more suggestions, it stops.

## Developer

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate tui-labeller

pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
pre-commit run --all
```

## Publish pip package

Install the pip package locally with:

```bash
rm -r build
python -m build
pip install -e .
```

Upload the pip package to the world with:

```bash
rm -r build
python -m build
python3 -m twine upload dist/\*
```

## Sphinx documentation

To generate the documentation ensure the pip package is installed locally, such
that the documentation is able to import its Python files.

```bash
rm -r build
python -m build
pip install -e .
```

Then build the documentation with::

```sh
cd docs
make html
```

You can now see all your auto-generated Sphinx documentation in:
[docs/build/html/index.html](docs/build/html/index.html). This repository
auto-generates the Sphinx documentation for all your Python files using the
[/docs/source/conf.py](/docs/source/conf.py) file.

### Additional manual documentation

- The [docs/source/index.rst](docs/source/index.rst) is autogenerated and
  contains the main page and documentation file-structure.
- You can also add additional manual documentation in Markdown format as files in:

```
docs/source/manual_documenation/your_manual_documentation_filename.md
docs/source/manual_documenation/another_manual_documentation_filename.md
```

and then adding those filepaths into the `docs/source/manual.rst` file like:

```rst
Handwritten Documentation
=========================
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   manual_documenation/your_manual_documentation_filename.md
   another_manual_documentation_filename.md
```
